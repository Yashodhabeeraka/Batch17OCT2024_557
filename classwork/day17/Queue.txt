Queue Operations:

in stack (top==max) stack is full
(top == bottom) stack is empty

example: pipe (in flow of water in one direction)
<--__________-->
o/p__________i/p

top --> called as rare. and the rare is the initial position.

1. condition --> front == rare --> empty queue. 

--> the rare is increasing or growing up to the max

if (rare == max) the queue is full for the insert operation.

2. condition --> front == max -->  

if (front == max) the queue is empty 

when front reaches max or when front reaches rare we need to reset the front and rare.
how to reset means that front and rare should be zero.
