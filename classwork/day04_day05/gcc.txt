GCC: 
	• GNU project c and c++ compiler

	• -std-mentions which standard or version I'll be using.
	• -I : to include a particular directory(third party files)
	• -c : compiles, -E : preprocessed state
	• Gcc -Wall -c main.c - to compile
	• Gcc -S main.c-to get assembler code
	• Gcc --- save-temps : to get intermediatory files
