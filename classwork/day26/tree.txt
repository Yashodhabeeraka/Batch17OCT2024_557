Trees: 

binary tree: Binary treeis a rooted tree in which no vertex has more than two children.
struct binaryNode;
{
	object 		element;	//the data in the node
	binaryNode	*left;		//left child
	binaryNode 	*right;	//rigth child
};

node(13)
degree of a node
leaf(terminal) - no child
nonterminal
parent
childern
sibling
degree of a tree(3)
Ancestor
level of a node

full binary tree

what is perfect binary tree? 
the leaves should be same level
if all its internal node are same level or with out generating another child

Complete binary tree?
which every level except possibly the last is completely filled and all nodes are as far left as possible.
- having more node at the left side.
-it seems to mean a balanced tree.

Note:
--  All perfect binary trees are complete binary trees, but reverse is not true.
--  It is complete binary tree, but not a perfect binary tree.

Balance binary tree:

A(3,2)--B(2,2),C(0,1)
it is a balance binary tree as for all nodes, difference of left and right subtree height is not more than one
C(0,2)
Node C violates the property of balanced binary tree

who to calculate the height of the binary tree?
(2^(n-1))

Programs:
write a c program to insert nodes in a binary tree 
- inorder, preorder, post order traversals

write a c program to insert nodes in a binary search tree

write a c program to find the level of a tree

write a c program to find the max/min elements of a tree

Depth first traversals:
-preorder traversal 	- vertex,left,right sub tree
-inorder traversal 	- left, vertex,right subtree
-postorder traversal 	- left, vertex, right

if we give elements : 5,10,3,4,8,1,2,13
the first element of the given element is always the root the tree. so, 5 is the root of the tree
right of 5 is the node 10 -- that means the 5 is the root of the tree then next element of the root compares and moves to left or right.
5 less 3 then it inserts in to left

if 3 becomes root, the next element 4 will check with 3 and 3 is less 4 then it moves to left.

5,10,3,4,8,1,2,13

			  5	
		3			10
	1		4	8		13
		2

- inorder (LNR) left node right:  1,2,3,4, 5, 8,10,13.
we have to apply LNR to the each node.

- preorder (NLR) Node left right: 5,3,1,2,4,10,8,13.
we have to see the node and we print the node first then move to the left sub tree and printing the left side of the sub trees and comes to the right side of the subtree. and moves back the root checks the right side of the subtree and again the same checks the left side of the subtree and come backs to rightside

-postorder (LRN) Left right node: 2,1,4,3,8,13,10,5.
here we have check the left side of the node, after printing the left side of subtree, it checks the rigth side of the subtree after printing all the subtrees after that node.

to find the level of a tree is use "Postorder tree".

Delete a node in BST

To delete a node there are 3 possibilities :
- delete a leaf node
- delete a node with 1 child(either left or right)
- delete a node with 2 child(i.e., root node)
